# DevOps Pizza App

The following Django based application consists of two main parts:
1. Order Placement Form: A form that allows users to place orders for pizza. This form
should include:
a. A dropdown menu for selecting the type of pizza (e.g., Margherita, Pepperoni,
Vegetarian, etc.).
b. A text area for comments or special instructions.
2. Orders Table: A page that displays all placed orders in a tabular format. Each row
should display the type of pizza ordered and any comments associated with the order.
